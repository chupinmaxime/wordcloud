      PCL5, PDF, PDF1, PBM, PGM, PPM, PS, markedEPS, markedPS, PNG,
      XWD, BMP, TIFF, JPEG, GIF, XPM.  a2ping delegates the low-level

      . a2ping fixes many
      glitches during the EPS to EPS conversion, so its output is
      often more compatible and better embeddable than its input.},

      The citation-style-language package is aimed to provide
      another reference formatting method for \LaTeX{} that
      utilizes the CSL styles.
      It contains a citation processor implemented in pure Lua
      () which reads bibliographic metadata
      and performs sorting and formatting on both citations
      and bibliography according to the selected CSL style.
      A \LaTeX{} package ()
      is provided to communicate with the processor.},

      Texts can be arranged in running paragraphs or on facing pages,
      in any number of columns which in turn can be synchronized or not.
      In addition to printed texts, ekdosis can convert  source
      files so as to produce TEI xml-compliant critical editions.
      Database-driven encoding under \LaTeX{} then allows extraction of texts
      entered segment by segment according to various criteria: main edited text,
      variant readings, translations or annotated borrowings between texts.},

      euro symbol is available; the package also includes code for
      printing fake bold euro symbols for use when no real bold symbol
      exists, as well as pre-configured support for a faked italic
      version of the  font.
      Eurofont comes set up to use euro symbols from Adobe’s Eurofonts,
      the  font, the  font, and any available Text
      Companion fonts.  The selection between these can be done using
      options passed to the package.  The eurofont package also
      ‘knows’ about the
       font’s euro symbol,
      and can be configured to use it.},
